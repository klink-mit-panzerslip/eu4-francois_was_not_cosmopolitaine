PURPOSE:
--------

Would you be puzzled if, visiting France, you'd be meeting people that never ever heard about this Cosmopolitaine culture you nonetheless spread in the name of France, while playing Europa Universalis?

Sure, people would say they know about the notion of cosmopolitism, from ancient greece to Immanuel Kant, at some point trendy in salons, about the idea that all humans belong to a single community, culture. Something that has little to do with how France was united, during Modern Era, with Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts and such.

And wouldn't that sound even very wrong, that you changed culture of some land from something like Gascon, Catalan, Rheinlander to... well.... being part of a culture that is common to the whole human race?

Cosmopolitain was never a thing in France; and contradict the very notion of culture as it is in Europa Universalis.

So this mini-mod remove this unfortunate choice of word and replace it with François. François means French in Modern Era French. That was the word actually used by Kings or even French revolutionaries to describe their people. It certainly somehow is a better word than Cosmopolitaine to describe the idea of Nation that was built up during this whole period in this country.

I made this mod to get rid of this inconsistency. This is a band-aid though, I don't think bugfixes should be mods, I think and hope people at Paradox will made the appropriate change.


TECHNICAL:
----------

- This mod does not change in any way of the game works and, thus, is compatible with Ironman mode
- I was not able to simply add the translation in new separate specific files, it seems that Paradox's Clausewitz engine ignore them if the string to be translated
